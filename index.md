## Document Management

### Creating New Safety Documents

1. **Select the appropriate template:**
   - [Risk Assessment Template](/templates/risk-assessment-template/) for hazard identification and risk analysis
   - [Safe Work Procedure Template](/templates/safe-work-procedure-template/) for detailed operating instructions

2. **Complete all sections** thoroughly and accurately

3. **Consult with:**
   - Equipment users
   - Safety officer
   - Relevant subject matter experts
   - Manufacturer documentation

4. **Submit for review and approval** to your supervisor and safety officer

5. **Once approved:**
   - Add document to this index
   - Display near relevant equipment
   - Provide training to all users
   - Add users to authorised users list

### Review Requirements

All Risk Assessments and Safe Work Procedures must be reviewed:

- **Annually** at minimum
- After any incident or near-miss
- When equipment is modified or upgraded
- When new hazards are identified
- When procedures change
- When Australian Standards are updated
