  **CLASS 4 LASER - MOST HAZARDOUS CLASSIFICATION**
  
  The Bambu H2D laser module is Class 4. Class 4 lasers can cause immediate and permanent eye damage, severe burns, and fire. The H2D operates as Class 1 (safe) ONLY when all safety systems are intact and functioning.

# CLASS 4 LASER SAFETY - BAMBU H2D

## Understanding Class 4 Lasers

### What is a Class 4 Laser?

Class 4 is the **highest and most dangerous** laser safety classification. The Bambu H2D's laser module (455nm, 10W blue laser) is Class 4.

### Hazards of Class 4 Lasers

**Eye Hazards:**
- Can cause **immediate and permanent eye damage**
- Can cause **total blindness** from direct or reflected beams
- Damage can occur **faster than the blink reflex** (< 0.25 seconds)
- Viewing the beam even briefly can cause retinal burns
- Diffuse reflections (from any surface) can be hazardous

**Skin Hazards:**
- Can cause **severe burns** to skin
- Can ignite **clothing** and other materials
- Burns can occur within seconds of exposure

**Fire Hazards:**
- Can **ignite flammable materials** instantly
- Can cause fires in work materials (wood, paper, plastics, etc.)
- Reflections can ignite materials at a distance

### Why the H2D is Safe When Used Correctly

The Bambu H2D is designed to operate as a **Class 1 laser product** when all safety systems are intact:

**Engineering Controls:**
1. **Laser Safety Windows** - Green-tinted windows block laser wavelength
2. **Interlocked Enclosure** - Laser stops if any door/cover is opened
3. **Safety Sensors** - Front door, top cover, and safety window sensors
4. **Complete Enclosure** - All laser radiation contained when closed
5. **Emergency Stop** - Immediately halts laser operation

**When all these systems are functioning, the H2D is as safe as a laser pointer (Class 1).**

## Critical Safety Requirements

### ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS

These actions would expose you to Class 4 laser radiation:

❌ **NEVER** open any door or cover while laser is operating
❌ **NEVER** defeat or bypass any safety interlock
❌ **NEVER** remove or damage laser safety windows
❌ **NEVER** operate with any enclosure panel removed
❌ **NEVER** look at the laser emission point
❌ **NEVER** use mirrors or reflective objects near the laser
❌ **NEVER** attempt to service the laser module yourself

### MANDATORY SAFETY PRACTICES

✓ **ALWAYS** ensure all doors and covers are fully closed before starting
✓ **ALWAYS** check that all safety interlocks are working
✓ **ALWAYS** use the emergency stop if anything seems wrong
✓ **ALWAYS** report any damage to safety systems immediately
✓ **ALWAYS** ensure exhaust ventilation is connected and operating
✓ **NEVER** leave the equipment unattended during laser operations

## Safety System Verification

Before EVERY use, verify:

1. **Laser safety windows** are clean, intact, no cracks or damage
2. **Front door** closes fully and interlock functions (laser stops when opened)
3. **Top glass cover** closes fully and interlock functions
4. **Emergency stop button** is accessible and functional
5. **All enclosure panels** are in place and secure
6. **No unauthorised modifications** to any safety system

**If ANY item fails verification: DO NOT USE. Lock out and tag the equipment.**

## Emergency Procedures

### If Safety System Fails During Operation

1. Press **EMERGENCY STOP** immediately
2. Isolate power at wall outlet
3. **Do not open enclosure** - laser may still be active
4. Move people away from the equipment
5. Report to supervisor immediately
6. Lock out and tag equipment
7. Call qualified laser safety technician

### If Suspected Laser Eye Exposure

**This is a medical emergency.**

1. Press **EMERGENCY STOP**
2. **Do not rub eyes**
3. Close eyes or look away
4. Seek **immediate medical attention** at emergency department
5. Note: time of exposure, duration, circumstances
6. Report incident to supervisor and safety officer
7. Equipment must be locked out until investigated

### If Laser-Induced Fire

1. Press **EMERGENCY STOP**
2. **Do not open chamber** (introduces oxygen)
3. Use CO₂ or dry powder extinguisher through access points if safe
4. If fire cannot be controlled, evacuate and call 000
5. Activate building fire alarm if fire spreads

## Training Requirements

All operators MUST complete training on:

1. Class 4 laser hazards and health effects
2. Function and importance of ALL safety systems
3. Verification procedures before each use
4. Emergency procedures
5. Prohibited practices
6. Incident reporting

**Competency must be demonstrated and documented before authorised use.**

## Maintenance and Inspection

### Regular Inspections (Before Each Use)
- Visual check of all safety systems
- Functional test of door interlocks
- Check for damage to safety windows
- Verify emergency stop function

### Periodic Maintenance (Monthly)
- Clean laser safety windows (both sides)
- Check door alignment and seal
- Verify sensor function
- Document inspection

### Annual Verification
- Qualified laser safety technician must verify:
  - All interlocks function correctly
  - Laser safety windows provide adequate protection
  - Enclosure integrity
  - Safety system performance
- Documentation required

## Signage Requirements

The following signs must be posted:

1. **"DANGER - CLASS 4 LASER"** on equipment
2. **"LASER SAFETY SYSTEMS - DO NOT DEFEAT"**
3. **"NEVER OPERATE WITH DOORS/COVERS OPEN"**
4. **"REPORT ANY DAMAGE TO SAFETY SYSTEMS IMMEDIATELY"**
5. Operating instructions and emergency procedures

## Consequences of Defeating Safety Systems

**Disciplinary Action:**
- Defeating safety systems is a serious safety violation
- May result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal
- Exposes others to life-changing injury

**Health Consequences:**
- Permanent blindness
- Severe burns
- Potential death from fire

**Legal Consequences:**
- Violation of Work Health and Safety legislation
- Potential prosecution
- Liability for injuries to others
