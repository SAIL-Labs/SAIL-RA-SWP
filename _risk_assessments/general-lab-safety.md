**Risk Assessment Methodology**

Assessing the risk is a brainstorming exercise, which is most effectively carried out in a team environment with the people required to complete the activity or process. Most activities or processes are broken down into a variety of separate tasks. For each task, consider the hazards, the potential harm or negative outcomes and the conditions required for those negative outcomes to occur.

Whenever assessing the health and safety risks associated with a task, always consider the following primary risk factors:

- The **physical activities** required to complete the task e.g. repetitive movement, high force, physical exertion, awkward posture
- The **work environment** e.g. lighting, layout, traffic flow, ventilation, access to support (isolation)
- The **nature of the hazard itself** e.g. working with chemicals, microorganisms, radiation, use of plant and equipment, sharps, working with potentially aggressive clients, patients or research participants
- The **people involved**, e.g. level of training, supervision, experience, health, age, physical capacity.

The information gathered from the **risk assessment** process must be used to develop **Safe Work Procedures (SWPs)** and **local induction programs** for laboratory access and activities.

**Scope of This Risk Assessment:**

This is a **foundational risk assessment** covering general laboratory safety across all SAIL laboratory areas. It establishes baseline safety requirements and controls that apply to all laboratory users.

**Equipment-specific and activity-specific hazards** are covered by separate Risk Assessments and Safe Work Procedures, including:
- Individual equipment RAs/SWPs (e.g., Bambu Lab H2D, CMS, Form 3 printers, laser systems)
- Fibre Optics Handling RA/SWP
- Chemical Handling RA/SWP
- Electrical Safety RA/SWP

All laboratory users must comply with **both** this general RA and any applicable specialist RAs/SWPs for their specific activities.
