## Risk Assessment Methodology

Assessing the risk is a brainstorming exercise, which is most effectively carried out in a team environment with the people required to complete the activity or process. Most activities or processes are broken down into a variety of separate tasks. For each task, consider the hazards, the potential harm or negative outcomes and the conditions required for those negative outcomes to occur.

Whenever assessing the health and safety risks associated with a task, always consider the following primary risk factors:

- The **physical activities** required to complete the task e.g. repetitive movement, high force, physical exertion, awkward posture
- The **work environment** e.g. lighting, layout, traffic flow, ventilation, access to support (isolation)
- The **nature of the hazard itself** e.g. working with chemicals, microorganisms, radiation, use of plant and equipment, sharps, working with potentially aggressive clients, patients or research participants
- The **people involved**, e.g. level of training, supervision, experience, health, age, physical capacity.

The information gathered from the **risk assessment** process must be used to develop a **Safe Work Procedure (SWP)** or **clinical protocol** for the activity.

## Risk Matrix

*[Insert your organisation's risk matrix here]*

The risk matrix should define:
- Likelihood levels (Rare, Unlikely, Possible, Likely, Almost Certain)
- Consequence levels (Insignificant, Minor, Moderate, Major, Severe)
- Risk ratings (Low, Medium, High, Very High)
